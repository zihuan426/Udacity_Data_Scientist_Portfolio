## Installtion
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.


## Project Motivation

Due to the interest of Natural Language Processing, I was interested in using the Twitter US Airline Sentiment data to understand:
1. Which US Airline provide better services relative to others?
2. How to improve customer satisfaction for each US Airline?
3. Can I build a sentiment analysis classifier for them to save cost from human raters?

## File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions above. The tweets.csv is the data I use.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@zihuantang/how-can-us-airline-apply-sentiment-analysis-of-tweets-to-business-development-80067dde7a57).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Figure Eight for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
